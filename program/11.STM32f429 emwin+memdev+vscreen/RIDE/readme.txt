 - project .rprj/.rapp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                        structure that produces an executable image with RIDE7.

 - stm32f4xx_flash_extsram.ld: This file is the RAISONANCE linker script used to 
                               place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and 
                               data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in external SRAM. 
                               You can customize this file to your need.
